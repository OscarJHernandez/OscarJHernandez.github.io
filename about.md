I am a PhD. candidate studying theoretical nuclear physics at UBC and conducting my research abroad at the Johannes Gutenberg University in Mainz, Germany.
I conduct my research under the supervision of [Dr. Sonia Bacca](https://wwwth.kph.uni-mainz.de/bacca-sonia/), carrying out simulations of light nuclei.
